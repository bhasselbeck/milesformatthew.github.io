# Miles for Matthew
This 5K run/walk was created to honor the memory of  8 year-old Matthew Jester. Matthew was a bright little boy who loved to draw, build legos, play soccer and spending time with his friends, siblings and family. He had a special bond with his twin brother Nathan and little brother Ryan. They were best buds and brothers! His older sister was like a little mommy taking care of all of her siblings but especially Matthew's needs. When Matthew was entering preschool, he was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes. It was a huge change for everyone in the family but Matthew embraced his special need and even kept track of what he ate and was very aware of when he felt like his sugar was low. Matthew was very active and loved to play outside with his brothers and had many friends on and off the soccer field. September 17, 2013 was the day that our lives changed. Matthew became our Angel that Tuesday morning...
